"""
delivery_verifier.py
─────────────────────
Handles delivery PIN generation and verification.

Flow:
  1. plan_logistics() calls create_shipment() → generates 4-digit PIN, saves to CSV
  2. Transport agent shows PIN to driver → driver asks customer to read it
  3. Frontend calls verify_pin(shipment_id, entered_pin) → marks DELIVERED if correct
